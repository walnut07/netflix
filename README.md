# ðŸ“º Netflix Data Science Project ðŸ“º

## About
With jupyter notebook, I visualized Netflix data and ended up getting meaningful insights of Netflix content.

## Skills Used
Python 100% <br>
Libraries: matplotlib and seaborn 

## Highlight
In which countries were the movies and tv shows on Netflix produced?
From the graph below, it is obvious that the number of US movies is the biggest and India comes second.
People tend to assume Netflix streams movies of every part of the world but the fact is not - biased in the US.
